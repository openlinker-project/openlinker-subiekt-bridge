// Kontrahent.cs - one rule for "which Subiekt kontrahent is this buyer?".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// The rule lived in THREE copies - OrdersEndpoints, Invoicing and Program's
// WooCommerce shim - and all three carried the same defect, which is what
// three copies of a rule reliably produce.
//
// The defect: the lookup was `WHERE kh_Symbol = @sym`, an exact match on the
// BASE symbol. When Subiekt cannot use the symbol it was handed (because some
// other kontrahent already holds it) it appends its own counter, so the record
// is stored as `NORBERTKULUS(5)`. The next order derives `NORBERTKULUS` again,
// the exact-match lookup cannot see `(5)`, the address check against whatever
// old record DOES hold the base symbol fails, and a brand-new kontrahent is
// created - `(6)`. Then `(7)`. Every order, forever.
//
// Observed live on 2026-09-23: two purchases by one buyer produced kontrahent
// 94 `NORBERTKULUS(5)` and kontrahent 95 `NORBERTKULUS(6)`. That defeats the
// entire point of writing the buyer into Subiekt, which is to see how often a
// customer buys from you.
//
// THE RULE, in order:
//
//   1. NIP, when the buyer supplied one. A tax id IS an identity, so a match
//      needs no further checking.
//   2. OpenLinker's own customer id, when the caller supplied one. Also an
//      identity, and unlike the NIP every ordinary consumer has one.
//   3. Symbol - the base one AND Subiekt's own `(n)` variants of it - with the
//      address VERIFIED before the match is trusted. Two unrelated people
//      called Jan Kowalski derive the same symbol, and reusing that match
//      would issue the second one's document to the first one's name and
//      address, which the operator cannot see from Subiekt.
//   4. No match: the caller creates, and Subiekt suffixes if it must. Next
//      time, step 2 or 3 finds it.
//
// STEP 2 IS WHAT MAKES STEP 3 SAFE, and it is the whole point of this change.
// The symbol is derived from the NAME, so it is not an identity at all - it is
// a guess that holds right up until two customers share a surname. Before the
// customer id existed there was nothing better to guess with; now there is, and
// step 3 is demoted to what it always was: a fallback for a buyer we cannot
// identify, used only after the identities have had their turn.
//
// Step 3 therefore gained one refusal and one write:
//
//   - a candidate CLAIMED BY SOMEBODY ELSE is skipped, never reused. That is
//     the fix. `NORBERTKULUS` holding customer A is not customer B's card
//     however well the address lines up.
//   - a candidate claimed by NOBODY is adopted and STAMPED with this buyer's
//     id, so an install that predates the field converges card by card as its
//     customers come back, with no migration and no day zero.
//
// The adoption is a presumption, and an honest one: on the evidence the bridge
// has - same derived symbol, same address, no competing claim - this is the
// same person, which is exactly the presumption step 3 has always made. What
// changes is that the presumption is now RECORDED, so the next order does not
// have to make it again.
//
// Candidates are ordered oldest-first, so a repeat buyer converges on their
// FIRST record rather than drifting onto the newest duplicate.
