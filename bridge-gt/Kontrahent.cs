// Kontrahent.cs - one rule for "which Subiekt kontrahent is this buyer?".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// The rule lived in THREE copies - OrdersEndpoints, Invoicing and Program's
// WooCommerce shim - and all three carried the same defect, which is what
// three copies of a rule reliably produce.
//
// The defect: the lookup was `WHERE kh_Symbol = @sym`, an exact match on the
// BASE symbol. When Subiekt cannot use the symbol it was handed (because some
// other kontrahent already holds it) it appends its own counter, so the record
// is stored as `NORBERTKULUS(5)`. The next order derives `NORBERTKULUS` again,
// the exact-match lookup cannot see `(5)`, the address check against whatever
// old record DOES hold the base symbol fails, and a brand-new kontrahent is
// created - `(6)`. Then `(7)`. Every order, forever.
//
// Observed live on 2026-09-23: two purchases by one buyer produced kontrahent
// 94 `NORBERTKULUS(5)` and kontrahent 95 `NORBERTKULUS(6)`. That defeats the
// entire point of writing the buyer into Subiekt, which is to see how often a
// customer buys from you.
//
// THE RULE, in order:
//
//   1. NIP, when the buyer supplied one. A tax id IS an identity, so a match
//      needs no further checking.
//   2. Symbol - the base one AND Subiekt's own `(n)` variants of it - with the
//      address VERIFIED before the match is trusted. Two unrelated people
//      called Jan Kowalski derive the same symbol, and reusing that match
//      would issue the second one's document to the first one's name and
//      address, which the operator cannot see from Subiekt.
//   3. No match: the caller creates, and Subiekt suffixes if it must. Next
//      time, step 2 finds it.
//
// Candidates are ordered oldest-first, so a repeat buyer converges on their
// FIRST record rather than drifting onto the newest duplicate.
