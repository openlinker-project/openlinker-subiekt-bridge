// DocumentTypes - the numeric dok__Dokument.dok_Typ codes, MEASURED.
//
// This file replaces five `dok_NrPelny LIKE 'ZK %'` / `LIKE 'WZ %'` filters.
// Those existed because OrdersEndpoints.cs's own header recorded that the
// numeric code "was never established live", and they were the single most
// dangerous thing in this bridge: `dok_NrPelny` is rendered from an
// OPERATOR-EDITABLE numbering template, and the pattern needs a literal space.
//
// A customer numbering `ZK/18/2026`, `ZAM 18/2026`, or carrying a branch
// prefix matched none of them, and four things broke at once - every one of
// them with HTTP 200:
//
//   - FindExistingZk never matched, so EVERY retried order create minted a
//     duplicate ZK. That is the only guard against the retry-after-timeout
//     case, and the case is real: IdempotencyLock.cs records that the COM call
//     survives the client's timeout.
//   - FindExistingWz never matched, so stock was released TWICE.
//   - GET /api/orders/feed returned an empty page for ever.
//   - FindZkIdByOrderRef returned null, so no ZK ever reached 'zrealizowane'.
//
// The values below were established by running the query the header itself
// prescribed, against the live DEMO database on 2026-09-27:
//
//   SELECT LEFT(dok_NrPelny, CHARINDEX(' ', dok_NrPelny + ' ') - 1) pfx,
//          dok_Typ, COUNT(*)
//   FROM dok__Dokument GROUP BY ..., dok_Typ ORDER BY dok_Typ;
//
//   FZ 1 (14) | FS 2 (40) | KFS 6 (5) | MM 9 (2) | PZ 10 (21) | WZ 11 (66)
//   PW 12 (4) | RW 13 (2) | ZD 15 (2)  | ZK 16 (41) | PA 21 (32)
//
// One code per prefix, no overlaps, across 229 documents. A numeric filter is
// also index-friendlier than a LIKE on a rendered string, which the header
// noted as the second reason to prefer it.
//
// If a future install disagrees, re-run that query there: these are facts
// about Subiekt GT's document model, not about this database, but they are
// facts this project measured rather than facts it was told.
