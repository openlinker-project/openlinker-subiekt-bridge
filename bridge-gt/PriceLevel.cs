// PriceLevel - which of Subiekt's sale price levels this bridge reads and
// writes (#3365).
//
// Subiekt GT carries up to ten operator-NAMED sale price levels per towar, and
// shops routinely keep the e-commerce price on a dedicated one ("Internet",
// "Allegro", ...) while level 1 stays the shop-floor or wholesale price. Every
// query here was hardcoded to `tc_CenaNetto1`/`tc_CenaBrutto1` and the writer to
// the Sfera level whose `Id == 0`, so on such an install OpenLinker published
// the WRONG price to the marketplace and said nothing about it.
//
// Two numbering systems meet here and getting them confused is the whole
// hazard, so it is stated once:
//
//   * the OPERATOR and SQL count from 1 - "Poziom 1" is tc_CenaBrutto1;
//   * the Sfera object model counts from 0 - Ceny.Element(i).Id == 0 is that
//     same first level (confirmed live: writing Element with Id 0 moved
//     tc_CenaBrutto1 and triggered Subiekt's own recalculation of the others).
//
// So `PriceLevel.Configured` is the operator's 1-based number and
// `SferaLevelId` is that minus one. Anything that reports a level to an
// operator uses the first; anything that talks to Sfera uses the second.
//
// REPORTED EQUALS ENFORCED, structurally: both the read columns and the write
// target come from this one place, so they cannot drift into reading one level
// and writing another - which would be a price that means a different thing
// depending on which column you look at.
