// ImageUrlSignature - a bearer-free gate for /gt-image (#3365).
//
// /gt-image is excluded from BOTH auth middlewares: from basic auth by an
// explicit carve-out, and from the bearer gate because its path does not begin
// with /api. It also takes a SEQUENTIAL integer, so anyone who can reach port
// 5056 can enumerate the seller's entire product-image library by counting.
//
// A bearer token cannot fix it. The whole point of these URLs is that a BROWSER
// and a MARKETPLACE fetch them, and neither will attach a header OpenLinker
// chose - the URL travels inside an offer, not inside an API call. So the proof
// has to ride in the URL itself.
//
// The signature is HMAC-SHA256 over the towar id, keyed on the same shared
// secret the bearer gate uses, truncated to 128 bits and base64url-encoded.
// Truncation is deliberate and safe here: the value proves knowledge of the
// secret, it protects a product photo rather than a payment, and a shorter
// token keeps the URL usable inside marketplace payloads that have length
// limits of their own.
//
// It is an ENUMERATION gate, not an authorization system. It says "somebody
// who holds the bridge secret minted this link". It does NOT expire, so a
// leaked link keeps working until the secret is rotated - the same property the
// bearer token itself has, and acceptable for the same reason: the bytes behind
// it are a product photograph the seller publishes on a marketplace anyway.
// What it removes is the ability to walk 1..N and take the whole catalogue from
// outside.
//
// UPGRADING BREAKS ALREADY-STORED URLs, and that is not avoidable here.
//
// OpenLinker stores the image URL it was given at sync time. Every URL stored
// before this shipped carries no signature, so the moment the gate is deployed
// those URLs answer 404 - observed on the verification stand, where a spec
// asserting "a product image URL loads FROM A BROWSER" went red against a URL
// synced an hour earlier.
//
// It self-heals: the catalogue sweep rewrites `imageUrls` on its next cycle
// (20 minutes at the default cadence), and nothing already PUBLISHED to a
// marketplace is affected, because marketplaces copy the bytes at publish time
// rather than hot-linking. What breaks in between is OpenLinker's own
// thumbnails and any offer published inside that window.
//
// An operator who cannot accept that window should trigger a product sweep
// straight after deploying the bridge. There is no version of a gate on a URL
// that leaves URLs already in circulation working - a grace period that served
// unsigned requests would be a door held open on exactly the enumeration this
// closes, with no way to tell when it was safe to shut.
//
// UNSIGNED REQUESTS ARE STILL SERVED when no secret is configured. A bridge
// with no token has no secret to sign with, and refusing there would black out
// every image on an install that was working a moment ago - the token gate
// already fails such a bridge closed on /api, which is where the damage would
// be.
