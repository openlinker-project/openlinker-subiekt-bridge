/// The one response envelope every `/api/*` route answers with.

/// Four files carried their own private copy of this helper
/// (`InventoryEndpoints`, `OrdersEndpoints`, `ProductsEndpoints`,
/// `FiscalizationEndpoints`), and the PR #7 review named that as the reason
/// they will drift again: finding #11 was "these envelopes drifted apart", the
/// fix round had to repair two of them in the same commit, and the round after
/// added `failureMode` to all four by hand. Four separately-maintained copies
/// of one shape is how the next field reaches three of them.
///
/// `failureMode` is load-bearing rather than decorative. OpenLinker reads it to
/// decide whether a failure was TERMINAL - `'rejected'`, the provider provably
/// created nothing - or `'in-doubt'`, where a document may exist. Getting that
/// wrong releases the one-document-per-order guard (ADR-041 §3a) and a second
/// fiscal document becomes possible for one sale, so the default is the safe
/// one and a caller must opt into `'in-doubt'` explicitly.
