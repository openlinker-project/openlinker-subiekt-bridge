// ShippingBlockMerge - read back what this bridge previously wrote onto a
// document's remarks, so a later write ADDS to it instead of replacing it.
//
// WHY IT MOVED HERE. Sfera.WriteShipping ASSIGNS both d.Uwagi and d.UwagiExt.
// That is correct only for a caller that knows every field. Two callers do not:
//
//   - the WooCommerce shim route in Program.cs, which had this merge inline and
//     worked;
//   - the native PUT /api/orders/{id}/shipping route, which did NOT, and so
//     destroyed the previous status on every write. An order that went
//     "shipped" and then "cancelled" ended up carrying only "Anulowane", with
//     no trace that a waybill had ever been recorded.
//
// One copy, two callers. The shim's version is gone; this is the same code.
//
// Keys are the Polish labels ShippingInfo.Block() emits - the two halves are a
// matched pair and must be edited together. A label renamed on one side and not
// the other silently stops merging that field, which looks exactly like the
// defect this file exists to fix.
