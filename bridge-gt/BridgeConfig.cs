// BridgeConfig.cs - the bridge's one source of deployment configuration.
//
// Every value below used to be a `const` compiled into the binary, and the SQL
// connection string was a `const` in SIX different files. A second Subiekt
// installation therefore meant editing sources and recompiling, and the
// operator account, its password and the shared API token sat in version
// control as literals.
//
// RESOLUTION ORDER, highest first:
//   1. an environment variable  (OL_BRIDGE_*)
//   2. appsettings.json         (next to the .exe, reloaded never - read once)
//   3. the historical hardcoded value, kept verbatim as the default
//
// Rung 3 is what makes this change safe to deploy: THIS installation keeps
// working with no appsettings.json and no environment at all, byte for byte
// as before. A second installation supplies rungs 1 or 2 and needs no rebuild.
//
// The file is OPTIONAL and a malformed one is reported and then ignored rather
// than fatal: a bridge that refuses to start because a config file has a
// trailing comma is a bridge that cannot be fixed remotely, and every value it
// would have supplied has a working default.
