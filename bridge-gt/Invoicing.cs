/*
 * Invoicing bridge for @openlinker/integrations-subiekt (subiekt.invoicing.v1).
 *
 * Speaks the FROZEN contract in libs/integrations/subiekt/src/bridge/*.ts -
 * English /api/* routes, { success, data, error } envelope, Polish field
 * names inside the payloads. Reconciled against the real GT Sfera object
 * model (Pomoc/gta.chm, extracted 2026-09-21) - see per-method comments for
 * the exact InsERT.GT attribute/method names each write uses.
 *
 * This is what closes the double-invoice gap: once a connection using this
 * bridge has Invoicing enabled, ADR-041's one-document-per-order guard can
 * see a Subiekt-issued FS/PA and refuse a second document from another
 * connection (inFakt/KSeF) for the same order.
