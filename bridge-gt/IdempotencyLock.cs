/*
 * Per-key serialization for the check-then-act idempotency guards every write
 * endpoint in this bridge relies on (InventoryEndpoints.AdjustInventory,
 * OrdersEndpoints.CreateOrder, Invoicing.IssueInvoice/IssueCorrection,
 * FiscalizationEndpoints).
 *
 * Every one of those follows the same shape: a plain SQL SELECT against
 * dok_NrPelnyOryg for an existing document, and only if not found, a COM
 * write via Sfera.Run. The lookup and the write are two separate steps with
 * no lock in between - two overlapping calls under the same idempotency key
 * (a caller retry racing the original request still in flight; Sfera.Run's
 * COM-side wait is NOT tied to the HTTP request's cancellation, so a caller
 * that gave up can still have its original call land) can both observe "not
 * found" and both write. On this bridge that means a duplicate fiscal
 * document (FS/PA/KFS) and/or a duplicate stock movement (PW/RW/WZ) - a real
 * legal/financial defect, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * There is no DB unique constraint on dok_NrPelnyOryg to fall back on (it is
 * a free-text audit field on an accounting schema this bridge does not own)
 * and no cross-process lock is available on a single bridge instance, so
 * this is an in-process mutex keyed on the SAME reduced string that is
 * actually compared against dok_NrPelnyOryg - two callers racing under the
 * same logical key but a differently-shaped raw string (e.g. one already
 * hashed, one not) still serialize together as long as both sides reduce it
 * the same way before calling in.
