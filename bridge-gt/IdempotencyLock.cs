/*
 * Per-key serialization for the check-then-act idempotency guards every write
 * endpoint in this bridge relies on (InventoryEndpoints.AdjustInventory,
 * OrdersEndpoints.CreateOrder, Invoicing.IssueInvoice/IssueCorrection,
 * FiscalizationEndpoints).
 *
 * Every one of those follows the same shape: a plain SQL SELECT against
 * dok_NrPelnyOryg for an existing document, and only if not found, a COM
 * write via Sfera.Run. The lookup and the write are two separate steps with
 * no lock in between - two overlapping calls under the same idempotency key
 * (a caller retry racing the original request still in flight; Sfera.Run's
 * COM-side wait is NOT tied to the HTTP request's cancellation, so a caller
 * that gave up can still have its original call land) can both observe "not
 * found" and both write. On this bridge that means a duplicate fiscal
 * document (FS/PA/KFS) and/or a duplicate stock movement (PW/RW/WZ) - a real
 * legal/financial defect, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * There is no DB unique constraint on dok_NrPelnyOryg to fall back on (it is
 * a free-text audit field on an accounting schema this bridge does not own)
 * and no cross-process lock is available on a single bridge instance, so
 * this is an in-process mutex keyed on the SAME reduced string that is
 * actually compared against dok_NrPelnyOryg - two callers racing under the
 * same logical key but a differently-shaped raw string (e.g. one already
 * hashed, one not) still serialize together as long as both sides reduce it
 * the same way before calling in.

            // one key - which is exactly the traffic this lock was added for,
            // a retry racing the original still in flight:
            //

            //   3. B does GetOrAdd -> still this gate, WaitAsync succeeds,
            //      CurrentCount -> 0. B is INSIDE the critical section.
            //   4. A resumes and removes the entry: the dictionary still maps
            //      the key to this gate, so the compare-and-remove succeeds.
            //   5. C does GetOrAdd -> absent -> mints a NEW semaphore, enters
            //      immediately.
            //
            // B and C are now both inside `body()` on different semaphores.

            // `FindExistingZk` / `FindByIdempotencyKey` reads both answering
            // "not found", and two fiscal documents for one sale.

            // A ConcurrentDictionary cannot express "acquire-or-create, and
            // remove-if-idle" atomically, so the choice is a lock around both
            // halves or no removal at all. No removal is chosen: entries are
            // keyed on reduced idempotency keys and each holds one
            // SemaphoreSlim, so the growth is bounded in practice by the
            // distinct keys one process lifetime sees, and it is strictly
            // cheaper than the correctness it was buying.
            //
            // Worth stating plainly, because it is the assumption that breaks
            // silently: this is an IN-PROCESS mutex. It serializes one bridge
            // instance and nothing else, so two bridges against one Subiekt are
            // not protected by it.
